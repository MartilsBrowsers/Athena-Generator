# Athena-Generator
A tool to generate up to date Fortnite athena profile responses. Mainly used for my private server, but can be used in other applications such as Fiddler.

**NOTE:** This release does not include a compiled version, I may release that at a later date. In the event you do compile this repo, keep in mind this is the first release and bugs are bound to occur, thanks!

- Generate Athena profiles with either all cosmetics or only new ones from the most recent update
- Super fast execution time
- Easy to use and setup
